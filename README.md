# volt

Starter framework for building multitenant SaaS applications on Azure. This project is in incubation stage, currently buildling out specifications and ideas through the [Wiki](//github.com/chrfrenning/volt/wiki/) section before starting any coding.

Goal: Building a SaaS service requires a lot of boilerplate programming. Volt will make this process easier, providing a framework and building-blocks to help SaaS builders focus on their unique differentiators and business value generation.

Features: Planned features include user registration, tenant deployment, metering, billing, trial periods, price management including grandfathering, revenue (MRR/ARR) projection and modelling, maintenance window and sla management, teardown, backups.

Help needed! If you have competency or interest in this field, [join the discussion](//github.com/chrfrenning/volt/discussions)!
